  It is difficult to test this class since it involves dynamically loading
  classes from a code base that is changing. Therefore, tests focus on three
  things:

  0. At least 1 (> 0) optimizer is loaded.
  1. Only instances of base_optimizer are loaded.
  2. Calling the optimizer_classes property more than once does not load
     optimizer classes again since they are already loaded.
