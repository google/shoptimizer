"""A module for Shoptimizer API that fixes the length of the sizes attribute.

Reference: https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324492

The sizes attribute consists of a list containing a single string.
If this string is over 100 characters, the product will be disapproved.
This optimizer will trim the sizes attribute string to 100 characters and
ensure the sizes attribute only contains one value.
