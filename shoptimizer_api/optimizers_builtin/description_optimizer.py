"""A module for Shoptimizer API that optimizes the product description.

Reference: https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324468

This module appends product fields to the description, or creates a
description from product fields if no description exists. This is expected
to improve product performance. The following fields are appended if they
contain values or could be mined from the product:
  - gender
  - color
  - sizes
  - brand
