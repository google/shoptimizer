"""A module for Shoptimizer API that fixes title values.

Reference: https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324415

Products whose titles are too long or truncated forms of the item's description
cause poor performance. This optimizer will shorten the title if it's too long
and populate title with description if it was detected to be
truncated.
