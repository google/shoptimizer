"""A module for Shoptimizer API that sets free shipping when applicable.

Reference: https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324484

This module sets the free shipping attribute to 0 by detecting regex patterns in
the config file that represents free shipping in the title of a product. It does
not set free shipping when it detects an exclusion pattern (e.g. Except Okinawa)
even if a free shipping pattern was found in the title.

This module uses a config file located in
./config/free_shipping_optimizer_config_{language code}.json.

Make sure this optimizer is called before title-optimizer because
title-optimizer removes patterns representing free shipping.
